This repo contains code for images of traffic sign classification from *German Traffic Sign Database* ![GTSRB](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic-signs-data.zip)
This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. Originally, it was the task of the third project from Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree
The train dataset consists of 39209 images with 32x32 px resolution, test dataset - 12630. The datasets were provided by *Udacity*.

## Notebooks:

`Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb` Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier. Finally, **98.0%** accuracy on the test dataset achieved with one Convolutional neural network, based on GoogLeNet inception modules. The code uses TensorFlow only. Look through this [file](https://github.com/NikolasEnt/Traffic-Sign-Classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) to make yourself familiar with data and the implementation. `train_log_f.csv` is a log file of the CNN training process.
